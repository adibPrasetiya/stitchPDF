                StitchPDF was born out of a personal need. As someone who
                frequently works with PDF files, I found myself constantly
                looking for simple, reliable tools to merge, split, and manage
                my documents. Instead of relying on multiple online services
                with limitations, I decided to create my own solution.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-3">
                This platform was built to make my daily work easier—and now,
                I&apos;m hosting it online with the hope that it can help others
                facing the same challenges. Whether you&apos;re a student,
                professional, or anyone who deals with PDFs, StitchPDF is here
                to simplify your workflow.

                No hidden fees, no subscriptions, no watermarks. Just
                straightforward PDF tools that work.
